I made website for music school. 

The website consists of three different parts
First is a simple flexbox containers, which are supposed to be links leading to course module
Next is four cards featuring instructors of this frictional music school. I used concept of cards. I used pseoudoclasses to animate overlaying text
The final part is testimonials. I used borded 50% to make images appear in circle and played around with fonts

No bootstrap was used. All the animations, cards, and other segments are hand-made using pure CSS and HTML
